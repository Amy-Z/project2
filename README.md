Chatterbox is a messaging website that implements Python and Javascript together.
Socket.IO and AJAX were used for client side and server side communication, as well
as asynchronous requests. There are bootstrap css styling components as well.

This single-page application is an online messaging service using Flask.
Users are prompted to type in a display name, which is stored in LocalStorage.
After a username exists in LocalStorage, a the innerHTML dynamically changes, welcoming
the user to the website.

Users may either enter an existing channel or create a new channel. When the user enters
the name of a new channel, the name of the new channel is appended to a dropdown menu,
featuring the entire list of available channels.

Users can navigate to different channels and chat in different groups. They can see and
join existing channels to send and receive messages with one another in real time.

To send a text, type a message in the text box in the body area of the Chatterbox website.
Click the Send button to send the message, which will be appended to a list of all messages
in server side storage. The new message will be displayed below the text area, showing the
message, user who sent the text, datetime, and the current message in which the message
is sent.

I used Bootstrap to style my website. The components include jumbotron header and columns
for the left-side and body panels. I used css properties to innovate the design, espcially
in the color scheme and layout of the website.
